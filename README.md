# uboundedknapsack
multiple solutions for unbounded knapsack problem

Problem Statement :
	Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine the sum nearest to but not exceeding the
	target that can be created. To create the sum, use any element of your array zero or more times.
	For example, if arr=[2,3,4] and your target sum is 10 , you might select [2,2,2,2,2], [2,2,3,3] or
	[3,3,3,1]. In this case, you can arrive at exactly the target.
	
Function Description
	Complete the unboundedKnapsack function. It must return an integer that represents the sum
	nearest to without exceeding the target value.
	unboundedKnapsack() has the following parameter(s):
	• k: an integer
	• arr: an array of integers
	
Input Format
	The first line contains an integer t, the number of test cases.
	Each of the next t pairs of lines are as follows:
	- The first line contains two integers n and k, the length of arr and the target sum.
	- The second line contains n space separated integers arr[i].
	
Constraints
	1 <= t <= 10
	1 <= n, k, arr[i] <= 2000
	
Output Format
	Print the maximum sum for each test case which is as near as possible, but not exceeding, to the
	target sum on a separate line.
	
Sample Input
	2
	3 12
	1 6 9
	5 9
	3 4 4 4 8
	
Sample Output
	12
	9
	
Explanation
	In the first test case, one can pick {6, 6}. In the second, we can pick {3,3,3}.
